# **Assignment 5: CRAP Principles**

This document cites examples of the CRAP Design Principles from DMS290 Assignment03.
# Contrast
Contrast is a method by which the viewer's attention can be drawn to specific or important parts of the document.
**Name:** Rochester
**URL:** http://tbrown50.digitalscholar.rochester.edu/assignment03/
**Location:** Home Page
 - The white text is not a good contrast for the blue tinted background image and is not visually pleasing.
-  A different color palette for the home page with sharp contrast between image and text would have been better.  This can be achieved in several ways.  
	- One simple way would have been to choose a different background image than the blue tinted one
	- Choosing a darker color font may have helped as well.

# Repetition
Repetition ties the content together, unifying the look and feel.
**Name: ** Manila 
**URL: ** http://bhall.digitalscholar.rochester.edu/assignment03/index.html
**Location:** Every city page
- The sections for each city is very diverse, some cities talk about climate and geography while others have history and economy. 
- It would be good to have the same kinds of content for each city. The website will then feel more cohesive.

# Alignment
Alignment makes the page easier to read and understand.
**Name:** San Fransisco
**URL:** http://bmart13.digitalscholar.rochester.edu/assignment03/
**Location** San Fransisco Page
- Each section is a long unstructured paragraph without margins or indentation, making it uninteresting and difficult to read
- Create a template for the section with margins, indentations, or bullet points, so that the subject matter will remain cohesive throughout the page


# Proximity
Proximity is the principle of grouping related content together.
**Name:** Rochester
**URL:** http://tbrown50.digitalscholar.rochester.edu/assignment03/
**Location:** Giza Page
 - The three images are grouped together at the top of the page without any context.
 -  It would be better if the images were grouped within specific sections to provide context such as history or culture.
